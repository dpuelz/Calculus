## Course Description

Calculus drives our understanding of change and motion, powering modern science, technology, and data-driven fields from physics to AI. This course reinvents how we learn calculus by blending computing, modeling, and statistics, using R-based computation to make ideas directly relevant to the digital age. Students will move beyond rote symbolic work to apply calculus in real-world modeling and analysis, building the skills needed for modern scientific and analytical thinking.

## Course Objectives

- Understand functions as the fundamental objects for modeling relationships between quantities
- Master the nine "pattern-book" functions and know when to apply each in modeling contexts
- Use R to define, visualize, and explore mathematical functions computationally
- Assemble complex models from simple functions using linear combinations, products, and composition
- Fit mathematical models to data using least squares and interpret the results
- Understand derivatives as instantaneous rates of change and compute them for common functions
- Apply differentiation to solve optimization problems in science, engineering, and economics
- Use dimensional analysis to check work and derive scaling laws
- Approximate functions locally using linear and polynomial approximations

## Required Readings

- _Mathematical Modeling and Applied Calculus_ (MMAC) -- Alex M. McAllister and Joel Kilty
- [_Mosaic Calculus_](https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/) (MC) -- Danny Kaplan (Available online)

## Assignments

There will be 5 homework assignments to be turned in via Populi. They will be posted here.

- [Homework 1](assignments/HW1.pdf). Due Friday, Week 2 at 11:30a.
- [Homework 2](assignments/HW2.pdf). Due Friday, Week 4 at 11:30a.
- [Homework 3](assignments/HW3.pdf). Due Friday, Week 6 at 11:30a.
- [Homework 4](assignments/HW4.pdf). Due Friday, Week 8 at 11:30a.
- [Homework 5](assignments/HW5.pdf). Due Friday, Week 10 at 11:30a.

### Homework Rubric

1 = All answers incorrect or inadequately addressed and missing deliverables, severely lacking clarity, write-up unprofessional

2 = More than half of answers incorrect, severely lacking clarity, write-up unprofessional and/or missing deliverables

3 = The majority of answers are correct with a couple mistakes, write-up is not professionally compiled but legible

4 = All answers are correct and write-up is acceptable. This is the modal grade

5 = All answers are correct and write-up is exceptional. The student went above and beyond the prompts to investigate an area not explicitly requested

## Quizzes

There will be 5 quizzes on the Fridays of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The quizzes will be related to the homework, and we will mark up the quizzes in class directly after finishing the quiz.

- Quiz 1: Week 2, Friday
- Quiz 2: Week 4, Friday
- Quiz 3: Week 6, Friday
- Quiz 4: Week 8, Friday
- Quiz 5: Week 10, Friday

## Final Exam

The final exam will be held during the scheduled exam time (week 11 of the course).

## Software

### Local R (downloadable software on your computer)

You will need a local download of R to run our example code and for your assignments. Please install [R](https://cran.rstudio.com) and then [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your own computer (you want the "RStudio Desktop" version). Both are free and work on all platforms. R is the underlying data-analysis program we'll use in this course, while RStudio provides a nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetitive steps (e.g. loading data, saving plots) very simple.

## Course Cadence

There will be 5 quizzes and 5 homework assignments. The quizzes will be on the Fridays of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The homeworks will be due on Fridays at 11:30a (start of class) on the same days as the quizzes. The quiz content will be related to the homework, and we will mark up the quizzes in class directly after finishing the quiz. We will have a final exam during the scheduled exam time (on week 11 of the course).
